            <strong>Check-In/Check-Out:</strong>
            Check-in time is 4:00 p.m. (EST). We do our very best to allow for early check-in whenever possible. However, unavoidable delays may occur, and there is a possibility your vacation rental may not be ready by 4:00 p.m. (EST). Your patience will be appreciated. Entry to the home is done through lockbox codes, so guests do not need to check in with anyone when they arrive. We will email you the codes to get in the day before arrival. Check-out time is by 10:00 a.m. (EST) firm unless previously arranged in writing, so we may prepare for our next arrival.
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Inclement Weather:</strong>
            There are NO REFUNDS for hurricanes, storms, or weather conditions, even if a mandatory evacuation is ordered (optional travel insurance may be obtained through a third party. Renter ASSUMES THE RISK).
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Condition of Property:</strong>
            Owners have, to the best of their ability, given an accurate description of the property and its condition. Guest understands that it is considered as reserved "sight unseen". Our cleaning staff will have cleaned it before your occupancy. All electrical, plumbing, and appliances should be in working order. The failures of operation of certain extra amenities, such as TVs, games, or the Internet and Wi-Fi service are not a basis for any refund. Owner will make every effort to have these items repaired but does not guarantee that they will be repaired during Guests occupancy. When you arrive, if you find that the house has not been cleaned to normal standards, please notify the Owner immediately. We will do our best to have tradesmen attend to the problems but may not be able to fix everything over holidays and weekends. Under no circumstances will any of the rental money be refunded or returned because of the condition of the house. The Guest agrees to hold the Owner harmless from any liability for the condition of the house.
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Cleaning & Repairs:</strong>

Trash liners, bathroom paper, linens, towels, and hand soap are included and not to be taken from our home. Extra items needed are the responsibility of the guest.

Please note that cleaning does not include dishes & cooking utensils. Guest agrees to keep the house, furniture, and furnishings in good order. Removing, adding or changing furniture without Owner’s written approval shall be deemed a material breach of this Rental Agreement, and is strictly prohibited.

For inventory and maintenance purposes, a property management employee of the Owner may need to enter the premises. The same permission procedure applies as above. In any emergency, Owner or Owner’s servicing agents may enter the premises at any time without permission from Guest for the purposes of making repairs to alleviate such emergency. If Guest abandons or vacates premises, Owner may, at his option, terminate this agreement, re-enter the premises and remove all Guest's property. During guest stays, our property maintenance team may need short term access to the inside of our homes to replace well water filters, hot tub maintenance checks, etc. Outside the home they may be present for landscape services, pool maintenance, garbage services, etc. Regardless of the type of maintenance required they will be as careful as possible to stay out of our guests’ way.

Guests assume full financial responsibility for damages due to misuse or negligence and missing items. Prior to check-out, please report any damages that occurred during your stay as a courtesy and so that we can continue to maintain our home in excellent condition, if during your stay you find other items requiring repair, we request that this information be reported to us, as soon as possible.

            <strong>Holding Over:</strong>
            Because of the nature of Owner's business (short term winter and summer recreational rentals) Guest understands, and is hereby put on notice that any unauthorized "holding over" of the property past the stated rental period could severely jeopardize Owners business and cause loss of rental income from other previously booked guests, temporary and/or permanent loss of business, goodwill and reputation and, among other things, could force Owner to breach an agreement with similar short term summer and winter recreational Guest(s) who may have reservations during Guest's unauthorized "holding over" period. In the event, Owner may be legally liable in damages to said other guests. Guests should be aware that unauthorized "holding over" has been construed as a factor in establishing "malicious continuing occupation" of rental property, which may entitle Owner to treble damages in any unlawful detained action. Guest also recognizes the unauthorized "holding over" could be grounds in court as a cause of action for intentionally interfering with Owner’s prospective business advantage. In addition, we will charge $150.00 an hour past 10:15 a.m. on the day of check out.
            </li>

In such an instance, the Rental Agreement will be terminated, and Owner shall be entitled to otherwise recover all damages allowable under the Law. The Guest, as part of the considerations of this special rental, in recognition that this property is booked in advance by other Guests throughout the year, hereby waives all claims for damages that might be caused by Owner; re-entry and taking possession of premises or removing or storing property as herein provided, and will hold Owner harmless from loss, costs and damages occasioned thereof, and no such re-entry shall be considered or construed to be a forcible entry as defined in the VERMONT Code of Civil Procedure or other similar statutory provisions.
